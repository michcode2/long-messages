Why the gp should give me E

Why I want it (show knowledge of positives and negatives of types of E and AAs)
On Sunday, gender issues got in the way of my work, gender routinely does that

my transness is a fact and not up for debate

Already presenting fem to flatmates and friends, HRT seems like the obvious next step so I can develop the body that I want

History of unrecognised gender dysphoria, lots of disassociation, counselling at CAHMS, familial history of depression and aligning appearance with identity reduces negative mental health consequences

Already have an appointment with gender care

Breast development, fat redistribution, faster hair growth, stronger emotions all effects I want, E and AA needed for those
The risks of E (assuming not ethinyl estradiol) are just those that cis women experience, higher risk of blood clots, infertility
Risks of AA generally are just those of low levels of sex hormones
Spironolactone increased thirst, salt cravings, urination, decreased blood pressure
Cyproterone acetate can cause brain tumours and increase depression risk and these are cumulative so prefer to avoid it
Bicalutamide has a 1/4000 risk of lung or liver toxicity, so wanna avoid



Why the GP should prescribe it (GMC guidelines, knowledge and accessibility of DIY)
GMC trans healthcare section under ethical guidance says if the risk of me starting prescribed HRT is less than the risk of me starting DIY HRT, a bridging prescription should be started

But you should only consider issuing a bridging prescription in cases where all the following criteria are met:
* the patient is already self-prescribing or seems highly likely to self-prescribe from an unregulated source (over the internet or otherwise on the black market)
* the bridging prescription is intended to mitigate a risk of self-harm or suicide, and
* the doctor has sought the advice of an experienced gender specialist* and prescribes the lowest acceptable dose in the circumstances.

I have put off work to calculate the cost of diy from multiple websites, made an excel spreadsheet to determine the best way for diy was patches due to the fact they were available at the time. I have had everything in the basket, all I needed to do was press purchase, not an isolated incident

Good practice in prescribing and managing medicines and devices point 39: You should identify the likely cause of the patient’s condition and which treatments are likely to meet their needs






i am trans, have been using natalie and she/her with friends and family for a long time, starting to dress a little more feminine

have an appointment with Dr Bhatia, but after that it will be more than 4 month wait
i dont want to wait that so have been looking at resources for DIY, have looked at the website and seen how they fit into the budget, looked at a variety of methods
in discussions with family, the gmc guidelines on bridging hormones came up, so worth a shot here

transition is the only treatment for gender dysphoria

Gender dysphoria leads to mental health issues, personal and familial history with it
